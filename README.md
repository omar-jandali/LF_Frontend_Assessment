# LF_Frontend_Assessment
This is the front end assessment for Lucid Fusion's full stack developer position. I will created a carousel that will run in an infinite loop with the main text on the page being static. 

I did create a working version of a infinite looping carousel with background placeholder images, titls, and captions. It does not look pretty bit it does work. There were issues with getting to run off of a server, but when loaded into a web browser diectrly, it does work.
