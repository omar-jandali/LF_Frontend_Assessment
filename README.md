# LF_Frontend_Assessment
This is the front end assessment for Lucid Fusion's full stack developer position. I will created a carousel that will run in an infinite loop with the main text on the page being static. 

I did create a working version of a infinite looping carousel with background placeholder images, titls, and captions. It does not look pretty bit it does work. There were issues with getting to run off of a server, but when loaded into a web browser diectrly, it does work. 

Instructions for local server:
OPEN YOUR TERMINAL:

Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/omar-jandali/LF_Frontend_Assessment.git LF_Frontend`

Move into the new directory

`cd LF_Frontend`

Run the following commands to load the page

`npm install`
`npm run build-server`

Open in broswer

`locahost:8080`

Instructions for direct page load

Open your browser of preference

run `command + o` for mac or `ctrl + o`

open the `index.html` file from the popup window
